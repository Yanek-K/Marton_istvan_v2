        <p>
          The series was photographed using a Nikon FM 35mm Single Lens Reflex
          camera coupled with a Nikon Nikkor 50mm F1.8 ai-s pancake lens - third
          edition. The 50mm lens was used for 58 of the 61 photographs. For
          No.13 Joe’s Cleaners and No. 20 Bob, I used a Nikon TC-201 2x
          Teleconverter with the Nikkor 50mm. For No.28 Downward Dog, I used a
          MIR 20n 20mm f3.5 lens. The camera was used with manual wind-on only,
          without a coupled motor drive. The gear bag that I used is a Domke F2
          with a customized leather strap to allow it to be swung around the
          body smoothly. <br />
          <br /> ​ For measuring light I used a Minolta Autometer IV f. All of
          the photographs were taken measuring incident light. The exposure
          recommended was adjusted where necessary using a mental calculation.{" "}
          <br />
          <br /> ​ The film used was Kodak tri-x Pan 400 ASA. The film was
          processed using Kodak D-76 chemistry. <br />
          <br /> ​ ​ 35 rolls of Kodak tri-x Pan 400 ASA (36 exposures) were
          used. <br />
          <br /> ​ The silver gelatin prints were produced using a Beseler 23C
          II variable condenser enlarger with a custom anti-newton glass
          multi-format negative carrier to ensure perfect film flatness. The
          enlarger lens used is a Nikon EL-50mm f2.8. The silver gelatin print
          paper is Ilford Multigrade fiber-based paper. <br />
          <br /> ​ As the series covered one full season cycle with a wide range
          of lighting conditions I used the Ilford Multigrade split-filter
          method of printmaking to ensure that the entire series was balanced
          and had the same weight from the first to the last print. For this
          purpose, I used the No. 0 filter for the highlight detail and the No.
          5 filter for the shadows. Using the 0 and 5 filter gives full creative
          control of the tonal range at the printmaking stage. When the
          highlight is set and the shadow is set the mid-tones join up and hold
          hands naturally. These are the only two filters used in the
          printmaking. The prints were processed using the Ilford recommended
          optimum permanence sequence. <br />
          <br /> ​ The silver gelatin prints were scanned using an Epson V850
          scanner and prepared for the final stage of Giclée printmaking using
          Adobe Photoshop. The Giclée prints are printed using a Canon Pro 1000
          printer using Hahnemühle cotton paper. ​
