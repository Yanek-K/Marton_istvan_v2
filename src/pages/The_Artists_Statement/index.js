          I have created a visual symphony in C Major using light and shadow,
          timing and movement, and the classical rules of composition as a
          showcase of the beauty of the phenomenon of painting with light.{" "}

          Torontonians are at the edge of civilization to the south and at the
          edge of the vast wilderness to the north that stretches to the arctic.
          The series “Once upon a time in Toronto” is Canadiana. I incorporated
          elements into the scenes that are uniquely Toronto and depict the
          wildness as well as the sophistication of Torontonians. <br />
          <br /> A photographic identity of a city is determined by the
          photographer’s eye. Robert Doisneau, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and some
          of Brassai‘s work set the tone for the photographic identity of Paris
          where it is depicted as romantic and elegant. The New York style
          photographers set the identity of New York as a jumbled, noisy mass of
          people. I produced the series of Toronto to set the identity as wild
          and whimsical, where the animals are an inextricable part of human
          life, the mannequins have personalities and shop window displays are
          alive and we humans are in the relentless cycle of the seasons that
          cover an average range of 60 degree Celsius every full season cycle.{" "}
          <br />
          <br /> ​ I would like to extend my gratitude to the good people of
          Toronto who formed the orchestra in this visual symphony. ​
