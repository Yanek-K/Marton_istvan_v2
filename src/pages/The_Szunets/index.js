            The purpose of the Sz端nets in this classical symphony of light is to
            invite the viewer to remember the cyclic and ephemeral nature of
            time: everything returns to the beginning and everything comes to an
            end. <br /> <br />
            The Sz端nets also set the tone for each season and they are a vital
            element in the structure of this symphony, reappearing in a
            predictable and intuitively recognizable 1 - 4 pattern in varied
            form, and binding the symphony into a unified whole.
